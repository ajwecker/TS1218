	<strong>Tikkoun Sofrim</strong> is a joint French Israeli project aimed
	to make Medieval Hebrew manuscripts openly and freely available as
	texts.The project is combining automatic Handwritten Text-Recognition
	(HTR) and Crowdsourcing.
</p>
<p>
	In a first stage we analyse the manuscript layout and train <strong>Kraken</strong>,
	a deep learning engine for automatic reading. Kraken is reading quite
	well, with an error rate of less than 10% and often even less than 5%
	on the letter level.
</p>
<p>
	But this is not yet good enough.
</p>
<p>
	In order to further improve Krakenâ€™s automatic reading and provide
	efficient editions of the texts, we need the <strong>human eye</strong>. The tool
	in this website is aimed at achieving this goal.
</p>
<p>Here you can check the automatic reading and correct mistakes. In
	the next stage your corrections will be used for improving automatic
	reading as well as creating digital critical editions and enabling
	textual search of manuscripts in library viewers.</p>
<p>Tikkoun Sofrim is a joined French-Israeli project, developed by
	the EPHE, PSL, in Paris, the eLijah-Lab at the University of Haifa and
	the National Library, Israel. The project is supported by the
	Maimonides grant funded by the French Ministry of Higher Education and
	Research, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Israeli
	Ministry of Science. eLijah-Lab is supported by Hekhal Eliyahu NGO.</p>
