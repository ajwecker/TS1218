			<div class="content">
				<p>In order to maintain a homogeneous text layout, medieval
					scribes frequently used “line fillers”, special characters added at
					the ends of lines in cases where the text did not reach the end of
					line naturally. Another way was filling the remaining space with
					the first letters of the word of the next line. The scribe of the
					Geneva manuscript usually fills the end of lines with one or two
					diagonal strokes.</p>

				<p>Another way to fill the rest of the line is to write very
					large letters at the ends of the lines. These letters need to be
					written as regular letters. For example: - נוטל את.</p>

				<p>Due to the sanctity of the divine name, scribes have been

					the top left of the aleph).</p>

					In manuscripts written by Jews, there are many ways to write the
