	<p>The work on Tikkoun Sofrim is quite simple. In the center of the
		page you are presented a line from the manuscript, and below it the
		automatic transcription, done by Kraken. If Kraken made errors -
		correct them. If Kraken was correct - leave the text as is.</p>
	<p>If there are special characters in the text,deletions or
		additions, use the buttons under the text line to mark them.</p>
	<p>You can increase or decrease the transcription font size, for
		your convenience with the + and - buttons. You can also reset your
		corrections and return to the original text using the “reset” button.</p>
	<p>On the left side of the screen you can find the help area. There
		you can examine the whole page of the manuscript and select different
		help tabs where you can find explanations about the letters and how
		they are drawn; explanations about simple characters used for
		punctuation, the name of god and other purposes, explanations about
		deletions and additions and what to do whenever you encounter such
		phenomena in the manuscript.</p>

	<strong> Tips</strong>
	<p>Transcription of historical manuscripts is not easy and often requires
		considerable experience. Here are a few tips how to advance
		in your capacities:</p> 
		<p>What can you do if a letter is hard to identify?
		Click on the manuscript letters tab to visualize how different letters
		are written.</p>
		<p>If this does not help it is always useful to look for other occasions
		where this letter appears in the same line or one of the lines above or below.</p> 
		<p>If this did not help, consider looking at the Midrash edition or if 
		biblical text is cited, and see if the familiar text helps you
		reading the manuscript.</p> 
		<p>But be careful, we are ooking precisely for those places where the
		handwritten manuscript teaches us something that does not appear in
		the printed edition. Check carefully if the text in the handwritten 
		manuscript is identical to the printed one.</p>
